    <h1>Introducing me</h1>
    <div id="paragraphs">
        <p>
            My name is Dragana, and I'm from Ohrid. I recently completed my first year of education at the Faculty of
            Computer and Science Engineeringin Skopje. My primary areas of study are software engineering and
            information systems, and I have so far mastered <b>C and C++</b>. In addition, I'm proficient in <b>HTML and
            CSS</b>, and
            my next objective is to master <b>JavaScript.</b></p>
        <p>In addition to expanding my knowledge in the field I am studying, my time at <b>FINKI</b> has also allowed me
            to
            meet new people and form friendships that will last a lifetime. Collaborating with others in a group setting
            and sharing knowledge and experience has improved both my interpersonal and leadership skills. I have always
            thought of myself as a leader, not afraid to break the ice and help my team succeed.</p>
        <p>As Fyodor Dostoyevsky once said, <q>The mystery of human existence lies not in just staying alive but in
            finding something to live for</q>. I live for establishing a career as a software engineer and building
            connections to never have a dull day in my life.</p>
