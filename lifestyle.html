        <h1>My hobbies</h1>
        <p>I used to play handball for a local team in my hometown Ohrid. Nearly all the places I've visited around the
            world were with my team. Handball helped me develop my social skills and make many lifelong friends.<br>
            My favorite game to play with my family, especially with my father, is chess. Chess is a tactical game that
            takes a lot of patience and effort to master. Despite the fact that I am not a professional chess player, I
            am a fierce opponent.<br>
            Growing up, I spent a lot of time swimming. Living in Ohrid meant long summers at the beach or in the river
            in Struga. The main reason I love swimming is that you can achieve a state of calmness if you just relax
            while swimming with minimal effort and let your thoughts roam.</p>
