        <p id="txt1">I've been to a few places, some of which I've photographed. On my left, I have my winter excursions
            to the lovely Zagreb. Zagreb is actually one of Europe's oldest cities. In the summer, I enjoy visiting
            Montenegro and its stunning St. Stefan. Herceg Novi, often known as the 'City of the Sun', is a stunning
            holiday destination that should be on your bucket list. Croatia is very stunning in the summer, notably
            Dubrovnik, which I visited with my old classmates on my graduation trip.</p>

        <p id="txt2">Traveling to the Netherlands with my handball teammates was a thrilling experience. We went to a
            number of locations, but my favorite was Amsterdam. My all-time favorite city, Belgrade, is recognized for
            having the most exquisite parties. In Montenegro, I was blown away by the scenery and environment at Kotor
            and Gospa od Skrpjela.</p>
